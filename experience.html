                                <p>during my time in the big ideas lab at duke university, i worked to develop 
                                key algorithms and biomarker detection of the lab's own infection detection 
                                wristwatch. this allowed me to be heavily involved in the development of this 
                                product, and allowed for me to learn the importance of cross-functional team 
                                management. i analyzed multimodal wristwatch data and developed a new pipeline 
                                using linear algebra frameworks to develop an accurate steps detection 
                                predictive model and algorithm.</p>
                                <p>i also worked heavily with the data engineering 
                                    team to implement these biomarker detection algorithms into the google cloud via data 
                                    pipelines and clean, functional code, and allowed me to work in detail with the software 
                                    engineering team to implement our visualizations in the web application, along with optimizing
                                    algorithms for lower loading times on the web-app.</p>

                                <p> i interned via the duke impact investing group with ecolytics, a start-up dedicated
                                    to helping companies obtain b-corp certification and ensuring corporate sustainability and 
                                    social responsibility. here, i conducted SEO, product marketing data analytics, and A/B testing, 
                                    and provided optimization techniques and developed content strategies to improve organic visibility 
                                    against competitors.

                                <p> our consulting to ecolytics resulted in a 25% improvement in customer acquisition 
                                    and 20% increase in conversion rates. this was my first product data science experience,
                                    and it was amazing to play such a hands-on role in ecolytics' site product design. 
                                    being able to play such a proactive role in a start-up's growth
                                    and seeing the real-time implementations of our strategies was an immensely exciting experience, and further
                                    solidified my interest in leveraging tech for a positive impact.

                                <p> the summer before freshman year, i worked at the louisiana state university health
                                    sciences center as a statistics intern via the undergraduate summer research program. 
                                    i worked under dr. yu in the biostatistics department and the tobacco control initiative to analyze
                                    racial disparities in e-cigarette usage. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    to do so, we used the PATH study wave 5 adult cohort data, with 2,500+ variables and 35,000+ cases.
                                    this was a very complex dataset that required a large amount of data manipulation and wrangling,
                                    as many values were missing, while others weren't in a usable format (i.e. we had to manually create
                                    non-hispanic white, non-hispanic black, and non-hispanic other categories as race and hispanic/latino
                                    origin were 2 separate questions). 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    additionally, e-cigarette smoking was an especially popular topic within public health, so we had to find
                                    statistical methods that would allow us to extract insights that had not previously been studied. the answer: mediation
                                    analysis! we would identify risk factors of e-cigarette usage and analyze the mediating pathway to see which factors
                                    may help explain the e-cigarette usage disparity. i presented our approach and models to a school-wide poster symposium.

                                    this novel approach and application culminated into a publication in <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2571-905X/7/3/37">mdpi stats.</a>

                            via the beaver-works summer institute cog*works course, i got my first taste of coding and machine learning. this was a 
                            rigorous 4-week course in which we explored ml and ai via visual, auditory, and semantic applications. this was one of the most
                            challenging experiences in my academic journey, but so immensely rewarding. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            we worked with discrete fourier transforms, spectrograms, and peak-finding; activation functions and convolutional neural networks (cnns);
                            and large language models, rnns, and seq2seq models. the content was rigorous and intensive, along with weekly projects we had to 
                            complete to put these concepts into application.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            our final capstone project was a sea animal classification tool, where we fine-tuned a vgg-16 cnn model for visual classification and 
                            a resnet-18 cnn for audio classification. this was delivered as a pysimple gui allowing users to input a sea animal image or sound, and be
                            able to see the file's sea mammal classification, a description of the animal, the region where it is most commonly found, 
                            and a gallery of additional images.
